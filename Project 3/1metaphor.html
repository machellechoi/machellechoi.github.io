            <p class="medium">Metaphoric Poster</p>
            <p>In the Spring 2012, I designed a metaphor poster for a book called High Fidelity.  We were to come up with a metaphor relating to the book and create images that would visually represent the metaphor.  My metaphor was "integrating"; pertaining to the main character's life, the book is about him growing up and finally becoming a man.  For that reason, integrate, was chosen for all his life experiences coming into one, building his charcacter as a mature grown up.  Therefore, I designed an abstracted image on illustrator of multiple circular lines coming into one.  This particular image represents the metaphor, as coming into one, as well as a vinyl record; the grooves of the record are the lines in this image.  In addition, I added some type which is the summary of the book, as well as, the title.</p>
