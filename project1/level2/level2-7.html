        <h1>Learning how to trust<br>is learned through love alone.<br>But with an opposite family<br>trust wasn't learned at home.</h1>
        <h6>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the day I met<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a boy that meant so much<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what turned into a deep love<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;started with a selfish lust.</h6>
        <h1>When a mistake turned into a fault<br>a party foul of the worst kind<br>I didn't think forgiveness was handed<br>or if he could make up his mind.</h1>
        <h6>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time turned slower<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;making bodies wilt in decay<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when eventually your returning<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turned around a new day.</h6>
        <h1>Since then ties were made<br>and promises were strongly said<br>trust soon developed<br>from what I once left dead.</h1>
        <h6>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weeks bled into months<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we turned our lives as one<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;merging on a path<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that I thought couldn't be undone.</h6>
        <h1>Then that day came<br>which I should have known all along<br>when you would tell me your leaving<br>without ever knowing you wrong.</h1>
        <h6>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Held about so long<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you threw me under water<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drowning I seek assistance<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in hope for another tomorrow.</h6>
        <h1><br>Trust.</h1>
        <h6><em>It's a hard thing to come by. But once learned it can turn the<br> happiest people into the truest of all. Souls can bound together and<br> learn to accept the other's faults with an ache of happiness just<br> knowing that the person is theirs. Forever...</em></h6>
        <h1><br>But if broken...</h1>
        <h6><em>Then the world turns it's face. What once looked so innocent,<br> now bears walls of burden. Where one thing once held truth now<br> holds suspicion. No one is real. The eyes that once held honestly and<br> contentment. They are now hollowed through. Like digging a grace<br> in the ground, you can see in the hollow and know that the once<br> beautiful green grass...is now a dark deep hole. It's lonliness in the<br> worst form. Though surrounded by people. Family. Doctors...</em></h6>
        <h1><br>Help.</h1>
        <h6><em>Though surrounded by the world, the suspicion gives way<br> to apathy. No one is trusted with a heart that is tattered and shredded.<br> The eyes are hollow. You look into them, and you see a reflection<br> in the glass. No soul. No emotion...</em></h6>
        <p><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No trust.</p>
