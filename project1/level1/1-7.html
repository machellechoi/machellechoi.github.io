        <p>Left Behind<br>By: Jess Patterson</p>
        <br>
        <p>Learning how to trust is learned through love alone.<br><br>But with an opposite family trust wasn't learned at home.<br><br>Until the day I met a boy that meant so much what turned into a deep love started with a selfish lust.<br><br>When a mistake turned into a fault a party foul of the worst kind I didn't think forgiveness was handed or if he could make up his mind.<br><br>Time turned slower making bodies wilt in decay when eventually your returning turned around a new day.<br><br>Since then ties were made and promises were strongly said trust soon developed from what I once left dead.<br><br>Weeks bled into months we turned our lives as one merging on a path that I thought couldn't be undone.<br><br>Then that day came which I should have known all along when you would tell me your leaving without ever knowing you wrong.<br><br>Held about so long you threw me under water drowning I seek assistance in hope for another tomorrow.<br><br>
        <p>Trust.<br>It's a hard thing to come by.<br>But once learned it can turn the happiest people into the truest of all.<br>Souls can bound together and learn to accept the other's faults with an ache of happiness just knowing that the person is theirs.<br>Forever...</p>
        <p>But if broken...<br>Then the world turns it's face.<br>What once looked so innocent, now bears walls of burden.<br>Where one thing once held truth now holds suspicion.<br>No one is real.<br>The eyes that once held honestly and contentment.<br>They are now hollowed through.<br>Like digging a grace in the ground, you can see in the hollow and know that the once beautiful green grass...is now a dark deep hole.<br>It's lonliness in the worst form.<br>Though surrounded by people.<br>Family.<br>Doctors...</p>
        <p>Help.<br>Though surrounded by the world, the suspicion gives way to apathy.<br>No one is trusted with a heart that is tattered and shredded.<br>The eyes are hollow.<br>You look into them, and you see a reflection in the glass.<br>No soul.<br>No emotion...</p>
        <p><br><br>No trust.</p>
