        <p>Left Behind &nbsp;&nbsp;By: Jess Patterson
        <br>
        <p>Learning how to trust is learned through love alone. But with an opposite family trust wasn't learned at home. Until the day I met a boy that meant so much what turned into a deep love started with a selfish lust. When a mistake turned into a fault a party foul of the worst kind I didn't think forgiveness was handed or if he could make up his mind. Time turned slower making bodies wilt in decay when eventually your returning turned around a new day. Since then ties were made and promises were strongly said trust soon developed from what I once left dead. Weeks bled into months we turned our lives as one merging on a path that I thought couldn't be undone. Then that day came which I should have known all along when you would tell me your leaving without ever knowing you wrong. Held about so long you threw me under water drowning I seek assistance in hope for another tomorrow. Trust. It's a hard thing to come by. But once learned it can turn the happiest people into the truest of all. Souls can bound together and learn to accept the other's faults with an ache of happiness just knowing that the person is theirs. Forever...But if broken....Then the world turns it's face. What once looked so innocent, now bears walls of burden. Where one thing once held truth now holds suspicion. No one is real. The eyes that once held honestly and contentment. They are now hollowed through. Like digging a grace in the ground, you can see in the hollow and know that the once beautiful green grass...is now a dark deep hole. It's lonliness in the worst form. Though surrounded by people. Family. Doctors...Help. Though surrounded by the world, the suspicion gives way to apathy. No one is trusted with a heart that is tattered and shredded. The eyes are hollow. You look into them, and you see a reflection in the glass. No soul. No emotion...</p>
