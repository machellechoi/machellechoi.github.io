        <p>Left Behind &nbsp;&nbsp;By: Jess Patterson</p>
        <br>
        <p>Learning a mistake turned into a fault<br>a party foul of the worst kind<br>I didn't think forgiveness was handed<br>or if he could make up his mind.<br>Time turned slower<br>making bodies wilt in decay<br>when eventually your returning<br>turned around a new day.<br>Since then ties were made<br>and promises were strongly said<br>trust soon developed<br>from what I once left dead.<br>Weeks bled into months<br>we turned our lives as one<br>merging on a path<br>that I thought couldn't be undone.<br>Then that day came<br>which I should have known all along<br>when you would tell me your leaving<br>without ever knowing you wrong.<br>Held about so long<br>you threw me under water<br>drowning I seek assistance<br>in hope for another tomorrow.
        <p>Trust.<br>It's a hard thing to come by.<br>But once learned it can turn the happiest people into the truest of all.<br>Souls can bound together and learn to accept the other's faults<br>with an ache of happiness just knowing that the person is theirs.<br>Forever...</p>
        <p>But if broken...<br>Then the world turns it's face.<br>What once looked so innocent,<br>now bears walls of burden.<br>Where one thing once held truth<br>now holds suspicion.</p>
        <p>No one is real.<br>The eyes that once held honestly and contentment.<br>They are now hollowed through.<br>Like digging a grace in the ground,<br>you can see in the hollow and know that<br>the once beautiful green grass...is now a dark deep hole.<br>It's lonliness in the worst form.<br>Though surrounded by people. Family. Doctors...help</p>
        <p>Though surrounded by the world,<br>the suspicion gives way to apathy.<br>No one is trusted with a heart<br>that is tattered and shredded.<br>The eyes are hollow.<br>You look into them,<br>and you see a reflection in the glass.<br>No soul.<br>No emotion...</p>
        <p><br><br><br>No trust.</p>ng how to trust<br>is learned through love alone.<br>But with an opposite family<br>trust wasn't learned at home.<br>Until the day I met<br>a boy that meant so much<br>what turned into a deep love<br>started with a selfish lust.<br>When
